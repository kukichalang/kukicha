# Kukicha

**AI-assisted coding.**

You describe what you want. AI writes the code. Kukicha lets you *read* it.

Kukicha is a programming language designed to be read by humans and written by AI agents. It compiles to Go, so your programs run fast and deploy as a single binary with no dependencies.

## The Workflow

```
You describe what you want
        ↓
AI agent writes Kukicha
        ↓
You read and approve it  ← Kukicha makes this step possible
        ↓
kukicha build → single binary
        ↓
Ship it
```

You don't need to know how to write Kukicha as long as you can *read* it and spot when something looks wrong.

See the [Agent Workflow Tutorial](docs/tutorials/agent-workflow-tutorial.md) to get started immediately.

## Here's What AI-Generated Kukicha Looks Like

See if you can follow it:

```kukicha
import "stdlib/fetch"
import "stdlib/slice"
import "stdlib/sort"
import "stdlib/table"

type Repo
    name string as "name"
    stars int as "stargazers_count"
    language string as "language"

function main()
    repos := fetch.Get("https://api.github.com/users/golang/repos")
        |> fetch.CheckStatus()
        |> fetch.Json(list of Repo) onerr panic "fetch failed: {error}"

    popular := repos
        |> slice.Filter(r => r.stars > 100)
        |> sort.ByKey(r => r.stars)
        |> slice.Reverse()

    t := table.New("Name", "Stars", "Language")
    for repo in popular
        t |> table.AddRow(repo.name, "{repo.stars}", repo.language)
    t |> table.Print()
```

**What just happened:** Fetch repos from GitHub, keep the popular ones, sort by stars, print a formatted table. The `|>` pipe passes results between steps. `onerr panic` means "if something fails, stop and show this message." Four stdlib packages, zero boilerplate.

## Quickstart

### Prerequisites

**Go 1.26+** is required. If you don't have Go installed, [download it here](https://go.dev/dl/).

### Install Kukicha

**Option A — Binary download (no Go toolchain needed after install):**

Download a pre-built binary from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/kukichalang/kukicha/releases).

**Option B — Install with Go:**

```bash
go install github.com/kukichalang/kukicha/cmd/kukicha@v0.0.21
kukicha version
```

### Your First Project

```bash
mkdir myapp && cd myapp
kukicha init          # sets up your project and stdlib
```

Create a file called `hello.kuki`:

```kukicha
# hello.kuki
function main()
    name := "World"
    print("Hello, {name}!")
```

Then run it:

```bash
kukicha run hello.kuki
```

### Which Command Do I Use?

| Command | What it does | When to use it |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| `kukicha check file.kuki` | Validates syntax without running anything | Before committing — catches errors early |
| `kukicha run file.kuki` | Compiles and runs immediately | While developing and testing |
| `kukicha build file.kuki` | Compiles to a standalone binary | When you're ready to ship |
| `kukicha pack skill.kuki` | Packages a skill into SKILL.md + binary | When building tools for agent pipelines |

---

## What Can You Build?

### A Tool for Your AI Agent (MCP Server)

```kukicha
import "stdlib/mcp"
import "stdlib/fetch"

function getPrice(symbol string) string
    price := fetch.Get("https://api.example.com/price/{symbol}")
        |> fetch.CheckStatus()
        |> fetch.Text() onerr return "unavailable"
    return "{symbol}: {price}"

# you can use functon or func to define a function
func main()
    server := mcp.NewServer()
    server |> mcp.Tool("get_price", "Get stock price by ticker symbol", getPrice)
    server |> mcp.Serve()
```

Compile to a single binary and register it with Claude Desktop or any MCP-compatible agent. Add a `skill` declaration and run `kukicha pack` to generate a machine-readable manifest alongside the binary — see the [Agent Workflow Tutorial](docs/tutorials/agent-workflow-tutorial.md#packaging-skills-for-agent-pipelines).

## Beyond Readability

Kukicha compiles to Go — single binaries, goroutines, strong typing, memory safety, fast cold starts. No runtime dependencies.

But readability alone isn't enough. AI writes [nearly half of all committed code](https://shiftmag.dev/state-of-code-2025-7978/), yet [45% of it contains security flaws](https://www.veracode.com/blog/genai-code-security-report/) and AI-generated code introduces [1.7x more issues](https://www.coderabbit.ai/blog/state-of-ai-vs-human-code-generation-report). In 2026, [security debt hit 82% of organizations](https://www.veracode.com/resources/analyst-reports/state-of-software-security-2026/) and AI-generated code [introduces 15–18% more security vulnerabilities](https://opsera.ai/resources/report/ai-coding-impact-2025-benchmark-report/) at enterprise scale.

The Kukicha compiler catches common AI-generated vulnerabilities **at build time** — SQL injection, XSS, SSRF, path traversal, command injection, and open redirects while telling both you and the AI agent what safe alternative to use instead.

## For Developers

If you already know Go or Python, here's how Kukicha compares:

| | Go | Python | Kukicha |
|-|----|---------|----|
| Reads like English | Partially | Yes | Yes |
| Classes / OOP required | No | Common | No |
| Special symbols (`&&`, `__`, `**`) | `&&` | `__`, `**` | No |
| Compiles to single binary | Yes | No | Yes (via Go) |
| Built for AI generation + human review | No | No | Yes |
| Transfers to Go/Python | — | — | 1:1 |

Every Kukicha concept maps 1:1 to Go and Python — see the [Quick Reference](docs/kukicha-quick-reference.md) for a full translation table.
