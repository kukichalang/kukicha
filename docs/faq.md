## Coming from Bash / Shell Scripting

**Why not just keep writing bash scripts?**

| Bash Pain Point | Kukicha Solution |
|---|---|
| Quoting hell (`"${var}"`) | `{var}` in strings |
| `set -e` surprises | `onerr` per operation |
| No real data types | `int`, `string`, `bool`, `list of`, `map of` |
| `$1`, `$2` positional args | Named, typed function parameters |
| `if [ ... ]; then ... fi` | `if condition` with indentation |
| Arrays (`"${arr[@]}"`) | `list of string{"a", "b"}` |

## Coming from Python

**Why use Kukicha instead of Python?**

The syntax will feel familiar — `and`/`or`/`not`, indentation, `for x in items`, `# comments`. The differences are:

1. **Static types** — function parameters require explicit types; local variables are inferred.
2. **No implicit returns** — use `return` explicitly.
3. **Error handling** — `onerr` instead of exceptions.
4. **Single binary deployment** — no runtime, no virtualenv, no `pip install` on the target.

| Python | Kukicha |
|---|---|
| `f"{name}"` | `"{name}"` (no prefix) |
| `def greet(name: str) -> str:` | `func Greet(name string) string` |
| `**kwargs` / named args | `F(x: 10)` |
| `try: ... except Exception as e:` | `result onerr return` |
| `[x for x in items if pred(x)]` | `items \|> slice.Filter((x T) => pred(x))` |

If your work is ML/data science, stick with Python — Kukicha is aimed at CLI tools, automation, and AI agent tooling.

## Coming from Go

**Why not just write Go?**

You already know Go's power. The question is whether the syntax improvements are worth it.

| Go | Kukicha |
|---|---|
| `if err != nil { ... }` | `onerr panic "msg"` |
| `&&`, `\|\|`, `!` | `and`, `or`, `not` |
| `*Type`, `&var` | `reference Type`, `reference of var` |
| `[]string{"a", "b"}` | `list of string{"a", "b"}` |
| `func(s string) bool { return ... }` | `(s string) => ...` |
| `go func() { ... }()` | `go` with indented block |
| `case` / `default` | `when` / `otherwise` |

Everything else is the same: full Go stdlib access, `go mod`, goroutines, channels, interfaces.

**The pipe operator** is probably the biggest addition. Instead of:

```go
result := strings.ToUpper(strings.TrimSpace(strings.ReplaceAll(text, "\t", " ")))
```

You write:

```kukicha
result := text |> strpkg.Replace("\t", " ") |> strpkg.TrimSpace() |> strpkg.ToUpper()
```

Use `_` to control where the piped value lands when it isn't the first argument:

```kukicha
todo |> json.MarshalWrite(response, _)  # Becomes: json.MarshalWrite(response, todo)
```

**Where to start:** [Quick Reference](kukicha-quick-reference.md) — it's a direct Go-to-Kukicha translation table.

## General Questions

### I don't know how to program. Can I use Kukicha?

Yes — that's one of the primary use cases. The workflow is:

1. Describe what you want to an AI agent (Claude Code, Cursor, ChatGPT)
2. The agent writes Kukicha code
3. You read and approve it — the English-like syntax makes this possible without a programming background
4. Run `kukicha build` to compile a single binary

See the [Agent Workflow Tutorial](tutorials/agent-workflow-tutorial.md) to get started.

### Does Kukicha have a runtime?

No. The compiler transpiles your code to standard, idiomatic Go. Once compiled by the Go toolchain, there is no trace of Kukicha — just a native Go binary with zero runtime overhead.

### Can I use existing Go libraries?

Yes. Import any Go package (standard library or third-party) and use it directly. The compiler trusts external packages it hasn't seen before, giving you the full Go ecosystem.

### Which languages was this inspired by

Besides Go, so far Python, Elixir and Nim

### Why bother making an AI Agent friendly language? In the future we won't be able read what they generate anyway

Yes, applications will become specialized neural micro-models whose weights encode behavior; vector embeddings will replace rigid syntax, control flow is differentiable and self-adjusting, and correctness is ensured through formal mathematical proofs instead of tests.

But in the meantime let's try and keep a human in the loop!
