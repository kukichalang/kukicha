## What is Programming?

**Programming** is giving instructions to a computer. Just like you might follow a recipe to bake a cake, computers follow programs (sets of instructions) to perform tasks.

When you write a program, you're teaching the computer:
- What information to remember
- What calculations to perform
- What decisions to make
- What actions to take

Computers are very literal - they do exactly what you tell them, nothing more, nothing less!

---

## What is Kukicha?

**Kukicha** is a programming language designed specifically for beginners. Unlike many languages that use lots of symbols (`&&`, `||`, `!=`, etc.), Kukicha uses plain English words:
- For example, instead of `==`, we write `equals`

We also allow full English words for definitions:
- `function` (instead of `func`)

Kukicha compiles to Go (another programming language), which means your Kukicha programs run fast and can use Go's huge ecosystem of tools.

---

## Your First Program

Let's start with the traditional "Hello, World!" program. This is usually the first program anyone writes in a new language.

### Setting Up Your Project

Before writing code, let's set up a project folder:

```bash
mkdir my-kukicha-project
cd my-kukicha-project
kukicha init             
```

The `kukicha init` command initializes a Go module, extracts the Kukicha standard library, and downloads dependencies. You'll see it print progress messages — this is normal and only happens once per project.

### Writing Your First Program

Create a file called `hello.kuki` with this content:

```kukicha
function main()
    print("Hello, World!")
```

**What's happening here?**

1. `function main()` - This defines a function named "main". Every Kukicha program starts by running the `main` function
2. `print("Hello, World!")` - This built-in function prints the text "Hello, World!" to the screen 
3. Kukicha uses indentation (spaces) to understand where code blocks begin and end

**Try it yourself:**

```bash
kukicha run hello.kuki
```

You should see:
```
Hello, World!
```

Congratulations! You're now a programmer! 🎉

---

## Imports

When you want to use functionality from other packages (either Kukicha's standard library or external packages), you import them at the top of your file.

### Where to Place Imports

Imports always go **before** any other code — at the very top of the file:

```kukicha
import "stdlib/string"    # Import at the top
import "stdlib/slice"

function main()
    # Your code here
```

### Common Standard Library Packages

Kukicha comes with a standard library of useful packages:

| Package | What it provides |
|---------|------------------|
| `stdlib/string` | String manipulation (trim, split, contains, etc.) A string is text. |
| `stdlib/slice` | List operations (filter, map, sort, etc.) A list is group of words |
| `stdlib/fetch` | Make web requests |
| `stdlib/files` | File reading and writing |

### Using Imported Functions

Once imported, use the package name followed by the function:

```kukicha
import "stdlib/string"

function main()
    text := "  Hello World  "
    clean := text |> string.TrimSpace()  #  string.Trim() comes from stdlib/string
    print(clean)  # Prints: Hello World
```

---

## Comments - Leaving Notes for Yourself

As you write programs, you'll want to leave notes explaining what your code does. These notes are called **comments**.

In Kukicha, any line starting with `#` is a comment - the computer ignores it completely.

Let's update our `hello.kuki` file to include some comments:

```kukicha
# This is a comment - the computer skips this line

# Comments help you remember what your code does
function main()
    # Print a greeting to the screen
    print("Hello!")
```

**Try it yourself:**

```bash
kukicha run hello.kuki
```

**When to use comments:**
- Explain *why* you wrote code a certain way
- Leave reminders for yourself
- Help other people understand your code

**Pro tip:** Good code should be clear enough that it doesn't need too many comments. Comments should explain the "why", not the "what".

---

## Variables - Storing Information

A **variable** is like a labeled box where you store information. You give it a name and put data in it.

### Creating Variables

Create a file called `variables.kuki`:

```kukicha
function main()
    # Create a variable named 'age' and store 25 in it
    age := 25

    # Create a variable named 'name' and store "Alice" in it
    name := "Alice"

    # Use the variables
    print(name)
    print(age)
```

**Try it yourself:**

```bash
kukicha run variables.kuki
```

**Output:**
```
Alice
25
```

### Updating Variables

Once a variable exists, use a single `=` to change its value. Let's update `variables.kuki`:

```kukicha
function main()
    score := 0          # Create score, set to 0
    print(score)  # Prints: 0

    score = 10          # Update score to 10
    print(score)  # Prints: 10

    score = score + 5   # Add 5 to current score
    print(score)  # Prints: 15
```

**Try it yourself:**

```bash
kukicha run variables.kuki
```

**Key difference:**
- `:=` creates a **new** variable
- `=` updates an **existing** variable

### Top-level Variables
Sometimes you want a variable to be accessible throughout your whole file, like a configuration setting. For this, you use the `variable` keyword at the top level. Let's update `variables.kuki` again:

```kukicha
variable APP_NAME string = "My Awesome App"
variable MAX_STRENGTH int = 100

function main()
    print("Welcome to {APP_NAME}!")
    print("Max strength is {MAX_STRENGTH}")
```

**Try it yourself:**

```bash
kukicha run variables.kuki
```

> **💡 Note:** Kukicha is designed to read like English. While you might see `func` or `var` in some advanced code, we recommend using `function` and `variable` to keep your code readable and friendly.

## Types - What Kind of Data?

Every piece of data has a **type** - it tells the computer what kind of information it is.

### Common Types

| Type | What it stores | Examples |
|------|----------------|----------|
| `int` | Whole numbers (short for "integer") | `42`, `-10`, `0` |
| `float64` | Decimal numbers ("float" = floating-point, "64" = 64-bit precision) | `3.14`, `-0.5`, `2.0` |
| `string` | Text — called a "string" because it's a string of characters | `"Hello"`, `"Kukicha"` |
| `bool` | True or false (short for "boolean", named after mathematician George Boole) | `true`, `false` |

### Type Inference

Kukicha is smart - when you create a local variable, it figures out the type automatically. Let's create a new file `functions.kuki` to see this:

```kukicha
function main()
    age := 25              # Kukicha knows this is int
    price := 19.99         # Kukicha knows this is float64
    name := "Bob"          # Kukicha knows this is string
    isStudent := true      # Kukicha knows this is bool
```

**Try it yourself:**

```bash
kukicha run functions.kuki
```

### Why Types Matter

Types prevent mistakes. If you try to do something that doesn't make sense (like divide text by a number), Kukicha will catch the error before your program runs!

---

## Functions - Reusable Recipes

A **function** is a named block of code that performs a specific task. Think of it like a recipe you can use over and over.

### 1. The `function` (or `func`) keyword
This tells Kukicha we are starting a new function.

### Basic Function

Update `functions.kuki`:

```kukicha
# Define a function named Greet
function Greet()
    print("Hello!")

# The main function - where your program starts
function main()
    Greet()  # Call the Greet function
    Greet()  # Call it again!
```

**Try it yourself:**

```bash
kukicha run functions.kuki
```

**Output:**
```
Hello!
Hello!
```

### Functions with Parameters

Functions can accept **parameters** (inputs). Update `functions.kuki`:

```kukicha
# This function takes one parameter: a string named 'name'
function Greet(name string)
    print("Hello, {name}!")

function main()
    Greet("Alice")  # Prints: Hello, Alice!
    Greet("Bob")    # Prints: Hello, Bob!
```

**Try it yourself:**

```bash
kukicha run functions.kuki
```

**Important:** For function parameters, you **must** specify the type. Here, `name string` means "name is a string".

### Functions that Return Values

Functions can give back (return) a value. Update `functions.kuki`:

```kukicha
# This function takes two ints and returns their sum (also an int)
function Add(a int, b int) int
    return a + b

function main()
    result := Add(5, 3)
    print(result)  # Prints: 8
```

**Try it yourself:**

```bash
kukicha run functions.kuki
```

**Key points:**
- The type after the parentheses (`int`) is the **return type**
- `return` sends a value back to whoever called the function
- Parameters and return types must have **explicit types** (you write them out)
- Local variables inside functions use **type inference** (Kukicha figures it out)


---

## Strings - Working with Text

A **string** is text - any sequence of characters. Strings are surrounded by double quotes.

### Creating Strings

Create a file called `strings.kuki`:

```kukicha
function main()
    greeting := "Hello"
    name := "World"
    sentence := "Programming is fun!"

    print(greeting)
    print(name)
    print(sentence)
```

**Try it yourself:**

```bash
kukicha run strings.kuki
```

### Combining Strings

Use the `+` operator to join (concatenate) strings. Update `strings.kuki`:

```kukicha
function main()
    firstName := "Alice"
    lastName := "Johnson"

    # Combine strings
    fullName := firstName + " " + lastName

    print(fullName)  # Prints: Alice Johnson
```

**Try it yourself:**

```bash
kukicha run strings.kuki
```

### String Comparisons

Compare strings using English words. Update `strings.kuki`:

```kukicha
function main()
    password := "secret123"

    if password equals "secret123"
        print("Access granted!")
    else
        print("Access denied!")
```

**Try it yourself:**

```bash
kukicha run strings.kuki
```

**String comparison operators:**
- `equals` - checks if two strings are the same
- `isnt` - checks if two strings are different (also `not equals`)

---

## String Interpolation - Combining Text and Data

**String interpolation** lets you insert variable values directly into strings using curly braces `{variable}`.

### Basic Interpolation

Update `strings.kuki`:

```kukicha
function main()
    name := "Alice"
    age := 25

    # Insert variables into the string using {variable}
    message := "My name is {name} and I am {age} years old"

    print(message)
    # Prints: My name is Alice and I am 25 years old
```

**Try it yourself:**

```bash
kukicha run strings.kuki
```

### Why Interpolation is Awesome

**Without interpolation (the old way):**
```kukicha
function main()
    name := "Alice"
    age := 25
    message := "My name is " + name + " and I am " + age + " years old"
    print(message)
```

**With interpolation (the Kukicha way):**
```kukicha
function main()
    name := "Alice"
    age := 25
    message := "My name is {name} and I am {age} years old"
    print(message)
```

**Try it yourself:**

```bash
kukicha run strings.kuki
```

### Interpolation in Functions

```kukicha
function Greet(name string, time string) string
    return "Good {time}, {name}!"

function main()
    morning := Greet("Alice", "morning")
    evening := Greet("Bob", "evening")

    print(morning)  # Prints: Good morning, Alice!
    print(evening)  # Prints: Good evening, Bob!
```

### Interpolation with Expressions

You can put more than just variables in `{}`! Update `strings.kuki` one last time:

```kukicha
function main()
    x := 5
    y := 3

    # You can do calculations inside {}
    result := "The sum of {x} and {y} is {x + y}"

    print(result)
    # Prints: The sum of 5 and 3 is 8
```

**Try it yourself:**

```bash
kukicha run strings.kuki
```

## Making Decisions - If, Else If, and Else

Programs often need to make decisions. Think of it like choosing what to wear: *if* it's raining, take an umbrella; *else if* it's sunny, wear sunglasses; *else*, just head out.

Kukicha uses `if`, `else if`, and `else` to make decisions. Let's see how!

### Basic If

Create a file called `decisions.kuki`:

```kukicha
function main()
    temperature := 35

    if temperature > 30
        print("It's hot outside!")
```

**Try it yourself:**

```bash
kukicha run decisions.kuki
```

**Output:**
```
It's hot outside!
```

The code inside the `if` block only runs when the condition is true. If `temperature` were 20, nothing would print.

### If and Else

What if we want to do something when the condition is *not* true? That's what `else` is for. Update `decisions.kuki`:

```kukicha
function main()
    temperature := 20

    if temperature > 30
        print("It's hot outside!")
    else
        print("It's not too hot.")
```

**Try it yourself:**

```bash
kukicha run decisions.kuki
```

**Output:**
```
It's not too hot.
```

### If, Else If, and Else Chains

Sometimes you need more than two choices. Use `else if` to check additional conditions. Update `decisions.kuki`:

```kukicha
function main()
    score := 85

    if score >= 90
        print("Grade: A")
    else if score >= 80
        print("Grade: B")
    else if score >= 70
        print("Grade: C")
    else if score >= 60
        print("Grade: D")
    else
        print("Grade: F")
```

**Try it yourself:**

```bash
kukicha run decisions.kuki
```

**Output:**
```
Grade: B
```

Kukicha checks each condition from top to bottom. The first one that's true wins, and the rest are skipped.

### Combining Conditions with And, Or, Not

You can combine conditions using plain English words:

- **`and`** - both conditions must be true
- **`or`** - at least one condition must be true
- **`not`** - flips true to false (and vice versa)

```kukicha
function main()
    age := 25
    hasTicket := true

    if age >= 18 and hasTicket
        print("Welcome to the show!")

    isMember := false
    if isMember or hasTicket
        print("You can enter.")

    if not isMember
        print("Consider joining our membership program!")
```

**Try it yourself:**

```bash
kukicha run decisions.kuki
```

**Output:**
```
Welcome to the show!
You can enter.
Consider joining our membership program!
```

**Key points:**
- Conditions don't need parentheses in Kukicha
- Kukicha uses English words: `equals`, `isnt`, `and`, `or`, `not`
- Indentation defines what code belongs to each branch
- Only the first matching branch runs in an `if/else if/else` chain

---

## Lists - Storing Multiple Items

So far, each variable has held one value. But what if you need to store a whole shopping list, or a collection of scores? That's what **lists** are for. A list is like a numbered shelf where each slot holds one item.

### Creating Lists

Create a file called `lists.kuki`:

```kukicha
function main()
    # Create a list of strings
    fruits := list of string{"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

    print(fruits)
```

**Try it yourself:**

```bash
kukicha run lists.kuki
```

**Output:**
```
[apple banana cherry]
```

The `list of string` part tells Kukicha that this list holds strings. You put the initial items inside `{ }`.

### Accessing Items by Index

Each item in a list has an **index** - its position number. Indexing starts at **0**, not 1. Update `lists.kuki`:

```kukicha
function main()
    fruits := list of string{"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

    print(fruits[0])   # First item
    print(fruits[1])   # Second item
    print(fruits[2])   # Third item

    # Negative indices count from the end
    print(fruits[-1])  # Last item
```

**Try it yourself:**

```bash
kukicha run lists.kuki
```

**Output:**
```
apple
banana
cherry
cherry
```

**Why start at 0?** Almost all programming languages start counting at 0. Think of it as "how many items to skip from the beginning" - skip 0 to get the first item.

### Getting a Range of Items (Slices)

Single-item access is useful, but sometimes you want a portion of a list - the first three items, everything after the second, etc. You can do this with **slice** notation: `list[start:end]`.

Update `lists.kuki`:

```kukicha
function main()
    fruits := list of string{"apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "elderberry"}

    # [:n] - the first n items (up to but not including index n)
    first3 := fruits[:3]
    print(first3)   # [apple banana cherry]

    # [n:] - everything from index n to the end
    rest := fruits[2:]
    print(rest)     # [cherry date elderberry]

    # [start:end] - items from start up to (not including) end
    middle := fruits[1:4]
    print(middle)   # [banana cherry date]
```

**Try it yourself:**

```bash
kukicha run lists.kuki
```

**Output:**
```
[apple banana cherry]
[cherry date elderberry]
[banana cherry date]
```

You can also slice directly in a `for` loop without storing the result first - this is handy when you only want to process a limited number of items:

```kukicha
    for fruit in fruits[:3]
        print("- {fruit}")
```

**Output:**
```
- apple
- banana
- cherry
```

| Syntax | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `list[:n]` | First `n` items |
| `list[n:]` | From index `n` to the end |
| `list[start:end]` | Items from `start` up to (not including) `end` |

### How Many Items? Use len()

The built-in `len()` function tells you how many items are in a list. Update `lists.kuki`:

```kukicha
function main()
    fruits := list of string{"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

    print("Number of fruits: {len(fruits)}")

    if len(fruits) > 0
        print("The list is not empty!")
```

**Try it yourself:**

```bash
kukicha run lists.kuki
```

**Output:**
```
Number of fruits: 3
The list is not empty!
```

### Adding Items with append()

Use `append()` to add items to a list. One important thing: `append()` gives you back a **new list** with the item added - you need to save the result. Update `lists.kuki`:

```kukicha
function main()
    fruits := list of string{"apple", "banana"}
    print("Before: {fruits}")

    # append() returns a new list - save it back!
    fruits = append(fruits, "cherry")
    fruits = append(fruits, "date")
    print("After: {fruits}")
    print("Count: {len(fruits)}")
```

**Try it yourself:**

```bash
kukicha run lists.kuki
```

**Output:**
```
Before: [apple banana]
After: [apple banana cherry date]
Count: 4
```

**Key points:**
- `list of Type{items}` creates a list with initial items
- Indices start at **0** (first item) - negative indices count from the end
- `list[:n]` gives the first `n` items; `list[n:]` gives items from `n` to the end; `list[start:end]` gives a range
- `len(list)` returns the number of items
- `append(list, item)` returns a new list with the item added at the end

### Empty Lists

Sometimes you need to create an empty list that will hold items later. You specify the type so Kukicha knows what kind of items the list will contain:

```kukicha
    # Create an empty list of strings
    names := empty list of string
    
    # Add items later
    names = append(names, "Alice")
    names = append(names, "Bob")
    
    # Create an empty list of integers
    scores := empty list of int
```

Think of `empty list of string` as "a list that will hold strings, but starts empty." You can also write `list of string{}` with empty braces — both forms mean the same thing.

---

## Loops - Repeating Actions

Imagine you have a list of 100 students and you want to print each name. Writing 100 `print()` calls would be terrible! **Loops** let you repeat actions automatically.

### For-Each: Doing Something with Each Item

The most common loop goes through each item in a list. Create a file called `loops.kuki`:

```kukicha
function main()
    fruits := list of string{"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

    for fruit in fruits
        print("I like {fruit}!")
```

**Try it yourself:**

```bash
kukicha run loops.kuki
```

**Output:**
```
I like apple!
I like banana!
I like cherry!
```

The name `fruit` is one **you choose** - it's a temporary variable that holds the current item during each pass through the loop. You could call it `item`, `f`, or `snack` - whatever makes your code readable.

### Shortcuts: ++ and --

When counting, you often want to add or subtract 1 from a variable. Instead of writing `count = count + 1`, you can use the `++` and `--` operators:

```kukicha
count := 0
count++       # Same as: count = count + 1
count--       # Same as: count = count - 1
```

This is especially common in loops!

### Indexed Loops: Knowing the Position

Sometimes you need to know *where* you are in the list, not just *what* the item is. Add a second variable before the item name to get the index. Update `loops.kuki`:

```kukicha
function main()
    fruits := list of string{"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

    for i, fruit in fruits
        print("{i}: {fruit}")
```

**Try it yourself:**

```bash
kukicha run loops.kuki
```

**Output:**
```
0: apple
1: banana
2: cherry
```

Both names are **your choice**: `i` is the position number (starting at 0), and `fruit` is the item at that position. You could write `for index, item in fruits` or `for pos, snack in fruits` - the names are up to you.

### Counting Loops: From and To

Sometimes you need to count through a range of numbers. Kukicha has two styles:

- **`to`** - stops *before* the end number (exclusive)
- **`through`** - includes the end number (inclusive)

Update `loops.kuki`:

```kukicha
function main()
    # 'to' is exclusive: 1, 2, 3, 4 (stops before 5)
    print("Counting with 'to':")
    for i from 1 to 5
        print(i)

    # 'through' is inclusive: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
    print("Counting with 'through':")
    for i from 1 through 5
        print(i)

    # You can also count down: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0
    print("Counting down:")
    for i from 5 through 0
        print(i)
```

**Try it yourself:**

```bash
kukicha run loops.kuki
```

**Output:**
```
Counting with 'to':
1
2
3
4
Counting with 'through':
1
2
3
4
5
```

### While-Style Loops

Sometimes you want to keep looping as long as a condition is true. Just put a condition after `for`. Update `loops.kuki`:

```kukicha
function main()
    count := 5

    print("Countdown:")
    for count > 0
        print(count)
        count = count - 1
    print("Go!")
```

**Try it yourself:**

```bash
kukicha run loops.kuki
```

**Output:**
```
Countdown:
5
4
3
2
1
Go!
```

### Break and Continue

Two special keywords control loop behavior:

- **`break`** - stop the loop immediately and move on
- **`continue`** - skip the rest of this pass and go to the next one

Update `loops.kuki`:

```kukicha
function main()
    # break: stop when we find what we're looking for
    names := list of string{"Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "Diana"}

    print("Searching for Charlie...")
    for name in names
        if name equals "Charlie"
            print("Found Charlie!")
            break
        print("Not {name}...")

    # continue: skip items we don't want
    print("\nOdd numbers from 1 to 10:")
    for i from 1 through 10
        if i % 2 equals 0
            continue   # Skip even numbers
        print(i)
```

**Try it yourself:**

```bash
kukicha run loops.kuki
```

**Output:**

Searching for Charlie...
Not Alice...
Not Bob...
Found Charlie!

Odd numbers from 1 to 10:
1
3
5
7
9
```

**Key points:**
- `for item in list` loops through each item - the name is your choice
- `for i, item in list` gives you both position and item - both names are your choice
- `for i from X to Y` counts from X up to (but not including) Y
- `for i from X through Y` counts from X up to (and including) Y
- `for condition` repeats while the condition is true
- `break` exits the loop early; `continue` skips to the next iteration
- `%` is the **modulo** (remainder) operator — `i % 2` gives the remainder when dividing by 2. If the remainder is 0, the number is even; if it's 1, the number is odd

## Putting It Together - A Grade Reporter

Let's combine decisions, lists, and loops into one program. This mini project takes a list of student scores and prints a report.

Create a file called `grades.kuki`:

```kukicha
function LetterGrade(score int) string
    if score >= 90
        return "A"
    else if score >= 80
        return "B"
    else if score >= 70
        return "C"
    else if score >= 60
        return "D"
    return "F"

function main()
    names := list of string{"Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "Diana", "Eve"}
    scores := list of int{92, 75, 88, 61, 45}

    print("=== Grade Report ===")
    for i, name in names
        grade := LetterGrade(scores[i])
        print("{name}: {scores[i]} ({grade})")

    print("\nTotal students: {len(names)}")
```

**Try it yourself:**

```bash
kukicha run grades.kuki
```

**Output:**
```
=== Grade Report ===
Alice: 92 (A)
Bob: 75 (C)
Charlie: 88 (B)
Diana: 61 (D)
Eve: 45 (F)

Total students: 5
```

**What this program demonstrates:**
1. A function with `if/else if` that returns different values
2. Two lists working together (names and scores, matched by index)
3. An indexed `for` loop to walk through both lists at once
4. `len()` to count items
5. String interpolation pulling it all together
